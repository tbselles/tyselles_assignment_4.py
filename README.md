Game Title: College Life Choices
By: Ty Selles

What the Game is About
This game simulates a semester in college where your decisions affect your GPA, social life, stress level, and study hours.
 Your goal is to balance academics, stress, and social life to reach the best ending possible.

Branching Concepts Demonstrated

if / elif / else

Used for course planning decisions (e.g., taking more courses or not).

Logical Operators (and, or, not)

Example: Studying Programming boosts GPA if stress is low AND GPA < 3.5.

Math or English uses OR for balanced outcomes.

NOT History reduces stress instead of increasing it.

Multiple Endings

Final decisions branch into four possible endings based on GPA, stress, and social points.

How to Run the Game

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., college_game.py).

Open a terminal or Python editor.

Run:

    python college_game.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to make your choices.

Different Endings Represent

Ending 1: Dean's List → High GPA, low stress: The perfect semester!


Ending 2: Academic Star but Exhausted → High GPA but stressed out.


Ending 3: Social Butterfly → Fun times, but academics could be better.


Ending 4: Needs Improvement → Neither academics nor social life went well—better luck next time!

AI Assistance Used

Code structure and documentation help were provided by an AI assistant to ensure clean branching logic and multiple endings.

All final decisions, themes, and ideas were created by Ty Selles.
